# renpy-mcp

**A toolkit for making visual novels — by hand, with a browser-based
editor, or with help from an AI assistant.**

[Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) is the engine that runs visual novels
like *Doki Doki Literature Club* and *Slay the Princess*. It's free
and open source, but its scripting language is intimidating if you've
never written code. This project exists so you don't have to.

There are three ways you can use it:

1. **Just the editor.** A browser-based GUI with a Story Map, Choice
   View, Scene Inspector, and visual Composers for screens, stages,
   and menus. Click around; edit dialogue; preview the game in
   Ren'Py. No AI, no command line.
2. **The editor + an AI helper.** Run the editor in one window, run
   an AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, hermes-agent) in another,
   both pointed at the same project. Tell the AI what scene you want;
   watch the GUI update as it edits.
3. **Pure AI assistant.** Skip the GUI; let the AI do everything in
   the terminal. Fastest path from "I have an idea for a visual
   novel" to "there's a runnable game I can play."

If options 2 or 3 sound foreign, see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) —
it walks through "I've never used any of this" to "I can preview my
own VN" in about 15 minutes.

For the under-the-hood story (81 MCP tools, four tiers, a single
guarded write pipeline that keeps every edit lint-clean), keep reading.

## What it looks like

**Story Map** — every label in your project as a draggable card. Kind
badges (start / scene / choice / ending), drag-to-connect ports for
new edges, persisted positions. Built on native pointer events; no
React-Flow.

![Story Map](docs/screenshots/01_story_map.png)

**Scene Inspector** — opens when you click any node. Renders the
label's ordered event stream (scene, play, show, say, pause, set,
jump, …) as typed cards, each with the source line number. The forms
at the top edit background / music / dialogue; the *Insert event*
button at the bottom drops in pause / setvar / show / with / flash
events.

![Scene Inspector](docs/screenshots/02_inspector_event_stream.png)

**Choice View** — derived player perspective. Every top-level `menu:`
becomes a card listing its choices as pills with `if`-guard badges.
Click a target to jump back to its label in the Story Map.

![Choice View](docs/screenshots/03_choice_view.png)

**Library** — one tabbed surface for the project's reusable pieces:
Characters (cast cards with display name + accent colour), Assets
(backgrounds, sprites, audio), Variables (default values), Screens
(screen blocks + imagemaps), and Mini-Games (screen scaffolds). Each
tab edits via the matching Tier 3 tool; agents call the same tools
directly.

![Library panel](docs/screenshots/04_library_tabs.png)

**Localization** — per-language translation coverage from
`game/tl/<lang>/`. Click a row to load its stale-string list; the
"+ Scaffold" button runs `renpy.sh translate` to bootstrap a new
language.

![Localization panel](docs/screenshots/05_localization.png)

**Themed shell** — three surface themes (light / cream / dark), six
accent presets, sidebar variants (icon / labeled / palette). Every
preference persists in `localStorage`.

![Preferences modal](docs/screenshots/06_preferences.png)

**Ambient header** — the top strip surfaces project state without
demanding attention: a watcher pill (last edited file, freshness), a
Recent disclosure (the last N edits with jump-to-source), and a Lint
badge that runs `renpy.sh lint` in the background and pops findings
inline.

## Install

**MCP server only** (the common case — wire it into Claude Code,
hermes-agent, Cursor, or any MCP client):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fracturedring/renpy-mcp
renpy-mcp --fetch-sdk        # downloads Ren'Py SDK to ~/.cache/renpy-mcp/
renpy-mcp                    # auto-picks the cached SDK; no flags needed
```

`--fetch-sdk` is optional — pass `--sdk /path/to/renpy-sdk` (or set
`$RENPY_SDK`) if you already have the SDK installed. Pin a specific
version with `--fetch-sdk --sdk-version 8.6.0`.

`--project` is also optional (equivalently, set `$RENPY_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT`
— the flag wins if both are set). Either points the server at an
existing Ren'Py project root directly, anywhere on disk — it does not
need to live under `games/<slug>/`. When neither is given, the server
checks whether `<cwd>` is itself already a Ren'Py project root
(`<cwd>/game/script.rpy` exists) and binds there directly if so.

Otherwise — this matters if you install the server at **global/user MCP
scope**, where it attaches to whatever directory a session happens to be
opened in — the server starts **unbound** and creates nothing. It does
not scaffold a project into `<cwd>` on its own initiative; every tool
except `new_project`/`bind_project` returns a `"no project bound"` error
until an agent explicitly calls one of those two. Call `new_project` at
the start of a from-scratch conversation to scaffold a fresh, named
project under `games/<slug>/` — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the
happy-path flow. Already have a session bound to the wrong project? Call
the `bind_project` tool mid-session instead of restarting the server —
see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#default-folder).

For ready-to-paste MCP-server configs that fill in your local install's
absolute paths, run:

```bash
renpy-mcp --print-config claude-code  # emits .mcp.json
renpy-mcp --print-config hermes       # emits ~/.hermes/config.yaml block
```

**With the RPBuilder GUI** (requires a repo checkout until the frontend
build ships with the wheel):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fracturedring/renpy-mcp && cd renpy-mcp
gui/launch.sh                       # creates .venv, installs deps,
                                    # builds frontend, runs launcher
```

`gui/launch.sh` runs the **terminal launcher** that:

- scans your filesystem for a Ren'Py SDK (`~/renpy-sdk`,
  `~/Downloads/renpy-*-sdk`, `~/Desktop/`, `/opt/`, etc.) and offers
  the discovered ones,
- if none exist, offers to download the current SDK from renpy.org
  (with a progress bar) or to paste a path,
- maintains a recent-projects list with `<browse>` and `<new>` options,
- remembers both choices in `~/.config/renpy-mcp/launcher.json` (or
  `%APPDATA%` on Windows) so subsequent launches need at most a single
  Enter press.

After install you can also run `rpbuilder` directly from the activated
venv — same launcher. For the bare server without any picker, the
older `gui/run.sh /path/to/project /path/to/sdk` still works.

## Features

- **81 MCP tools across 4 tiers** (79 default + 2 opt-in) — reads,
  introspection, in-process diagnostics, lifecycle (preview / warp /
  drafting / translation scaffolding / distribute), guarded write
  primitives, high-level authoring intents (`new_project` scaffolds a
  runnable game in one call; composers stamp out screens, stages, and
  imagemaps from typed JSON trees), and opt-in escape hatches. Every
  tool description is tuned for small-model accuracy.
- **One-sentence-prompt friendly** — `new_project` + the Tier 3 intents
  are written so a low-tier model driving this server through a harness
  (hermes-agent, Claude Code) can turn a one-line premise into a
  runnable, distributable VN. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the
  playbook and `scripts/integration_drive.py` /
  `scripts/real_vn_drive.py` for end-to-end smoke tests.
- **Single guarded write pipeline** — every `.rpy` mutation (agent-
  driven or GUI-driven) routes through `apply_write`: path containment,
  cross-file label uniqueness, tab → 4-space normalization, atomic
  writes, `.rpyc` cleanup, unified diff in the response. Three
  documented exceptions (sidecar JSON files for canvas positions and
  diagnostic suppression, plus Ren'Py's own SDK-driven translation file
  emission) — see DESIGN.md §3.
- **In-process diagnostics complement `lint`** — `find_invalid_jumps`,
  `find_undefined_characters`, `find_unused_characters`,
  `find_missing_assets`, `find_undefined_screens`,
  `find_unreachable_labels`. Each shares a uniform response shape with
  per-rule suppression via `.renpy-mcp/ignored_diagnostics.json`. Cheap
  enough to call between every write.
- **RPBuilder browser GUI** — port-based editable Story Map with
  drag-to-rearrange, drag-to-connect, kind badges, and persisted
  positions; player-perspective Choice View; tree-driven Scene Inspector
  with typed event cards (say, scene, show, hide, play, stop, pause,
  jump, call, return, with, set, menu, if) and inline insert affordances
  for the five new event tools (pause, setvar, show, with-effect, flash);
  Characters; Assets; Variables; Music; Mini-Games; Languages
  (per-language coverage + stale-string list, with one-click
  `generate_translation_scaffolding`); Composers (Screen Layout, Stage,
  ImageMap, Menu); Build (lint + per-platform distribute). Theme tokens
  drive light / cream / dark surfaces × six accent presets, sidebar
  variants (icon / labeled / palette), preferences modal, ⌘K command
  palette spanning panels and labels. Watcher self-write suppression
  keeps the GUI from echoing the agent's own edits.
- **No chat panel in the GUI** — agent interaction happens in your
  existing LLM harness pointed at the same `renpy-mcp`. The file system
  is the integration point; the watcher fans filesystem events out to
  every connected WebSocket so the GUI stays live while the LLM edits.
- **Opt-in tiers** — `--tiers 1,2,3` is the default (reads + writes +
  intents); add `4` to unlock the escape hatches when the structured
  tools can't express what you need.

## Wiring it into an agent harness

### Claude Code

Drop a `.mcp.json` into any directory you open Claude Code from. Claude
auto-loads it on session start and exposes the tools as
`mcp__renpy__<tool_name>` (e.g. `mcp__renpy__list_labels`). A
[`.mcp.example.json`](.mcp.example.json) ships in this repo as a starting
point:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renpy": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/renpy-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "renpy_mcp",
        "--sdk", "/path/to/renpy-sdk"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Add `"--project", "/path/to/specific/project"` (or set
`RENPY_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT` in an `"env"` block instead, if your client
makes that easier to configure) if you want to pin the session to an
existing project — it works for any directory containing `game/`, not
just ones under `games/<slug>/`. Without either, the server binds
directly to `<cwd>` when `<cwd>/game/script.rpy` already exists (e.g.
Claude Code opened at the root of an existing Ren'Py repo); otherwise it
starts **unbound** and writes nothing — the agent has to call
`new_project` to scaffold a named subfolder, or `bind_project` to point
at an existing one, before any other tool will do anything. This matters
especially if you register `renpy-mcp` at **global/user MCP scope**
(rather than per-project `.mcp.json`): it will attach to whatever
directory an unrelated session happens to be opened in, and the unbound
default keeps it from ever writing there uninvited.

### hermes-agent

Hermes-agent (NousResearch) uses YAML at `~/.hermes/config.yaml` rather than
a project-local `.mcp.json`. Drop the contents of
[`.mcp.example.hermes.yaml`](.mcp.example.hermes.yaml) into the `mcp_servers:`
key, replacing the placeholder paths. Or have the server emit the right
snippet with your actual install paths:

```bash
renpy-mcp --print-config hermes --sdk /path/to/renpy-sdk \
  >> ~/.hermes/config.yaml
hermes mcp test renpy   # verify the connection
```

`--print-config claude-code` is the equivalent for `.mcp.json`. Tools show
up in hermes as `mcp_renpy_<tool_name>` (e.g. `mcp_renpy_new_project`). If
you only want the high-level authoring surface, filter to Tier 3 via
harness-level include/exclude:

```json
"tools": {
  "include": [
    "mcp_renpy_new_project",
    "mcp_renpy_get_project_overview",
    "mcp_renpy_get_media_invariants",
    "mcp_renpy_create_scene",
    "mcp_renpy_create_choice_node",
    "mcp_renpy_create_route",
    "mcp_renpy_add_dialogue_block",
    "mcp_renpy_add_character",
    "mcp_renpy_add_image_alias",
    "mcp_renpy_swap_background",
    "mcp_renpy_set_scene_music",
    "mcp_renpy_set_start_target",
    "mcp_renpy_get_lint_report",
    "mcp_renpy_launch_preview"
  ]
}
```

Or load only specific tiers at the server level. Three useful presets:

- `--tiers 1,3` — **recommended for small models.** Reads + high-level
  intents only (43 tools); no Tier 2 primitives competing with the
  composers. Tier 3 internally uses the writer pipeline directly, so
  authoring still works end-to-end.
- `--tiers 1,2,3` — default. Everything except the escape hatches.
- `--tiers 1,2,3,4` — adds `apply_unified_diff` and `exec_python_in_init`
  for cases the structured tools can't express.

Image generation is **not** part of this server — hermes ships a fal
image tool built in (`image_generate`, requires `FAL_KEY`). The flow is:
hermes generates the PNG and writes it to
`<project>/game/images/<name>.png`, then calls
`mcp_renpy_add_image_alias` to register it. `add_image_alias` probes the
asset against MEDIA.md's invariants (1920×1080 backgrounds, 1080-tall
sprites with alpha, etc) and surfaces deviations as `media_warnings` on
the response — call `mcp_renpy_get_media_invariants` BEFORE generating to
pin the right dimensions and avoid a regenerate loop. Same pattern for
audio (drop the file into `<project>/game/audio/`; music is referenced
directly by path in `play music` / `set_scene_music`).

### Cursor and other MCP clients

Anything that speaks MCP over stdio works — point it at
`renpy-mcp --project <p> --sdk <s>` and the tools register automatically.

---

## The RPBuilder GUI

Use `gui/run.sh <project> <sdk>` for production (builds the frontend on
first run and serves the SPA + API from a single FastAPI process on port
8765) or `gui/dev.sh <project> <sdk>` for a hot-reload backend + Vite dev
server. Both require a repo checkout — see the [Install](#install)
section above.

### Two demo scenarios

**Solo authoring (no LLM).** Open the GUI, build a scene visually in the
Story Map Inspector, hit Preview to play it. Every edit goes through
`renpy-mcp` so the underlying `.rpy` stays lint-clean and writer-guarded.

**LLM-assisted.** Run the GUI in one window and your LLM harness in another,
both pointed at the same project. Ask the LLM to "make Mei more sympathetic
in the cafe scene"; the file watcher pushes the change to the GUI's
WebSocket and the Story Map plus Inspector refresh live. Conversely, edits
made in the GUI become visible to the LLM on its next `read_character`
call. No explicit coordination — the file system is the integration point.

### Panel status

The left rail collapsed to four panels in Phase 2; each composes the
narrower views that used to be top-level rail entries.

| Rail panel | What it does |
|---|---|
| Story | Story Map (port-based editable graph — drag-to-rearrange, drag-to-connect, kind badges, persisted positions via `read_canvas_positions` / `set_canvas_positions`; toolbar adds Scene / Choice / Ending; Backspace deletes via `delete_label`) and Choice View (derived player perspective — every top-level `menu:` rendered as choice pills + `if`-guard badges) toggled by a mode pill. Selecting a node opens the right-docked Scene Inspector, which renders `read_label_tree` as typed event cards (say · scene · show · hide · play · stop · pause · jump · call · return · with · set · menu · if) with inline insert affordances and overlay Stage / Menu composers. |
| Library | Tabbed: Characters (`add_character` / `update_character`), Assets (Backgrounds / Sprites / Music / SFX from `list_images` + `list_audio` with usage-count badges), Variables (inline edit on `default` rows via `set_variable_default`), Screens (screen blocks plus the Screen Layout and ImageMap composers), Mini-Games (scaffolded screen+label pairs via `add_minigame_screen_scaffold`). |
| Localization | Per-language coverage bars from `get_translation_coverage`; click a row for the stale-string list from `find_stale_translations`; "+ Scaffold" runs `generate_translation_scaffolding`. |
| Ship | `get_lint_report` runner with severity-coded findings + raw-output viewer, plus per-platform `build_distribution` targets. |

The header carries the Preview toggle (`launch_preview` / `stop_preview`,
polled every 2s so external state changes sync without refresh), the
watcher pill, the Recent disclosure, and the ambient lint badge.

### Themed shell

Three surface themes (light / cream / dark) × six accent presets,
sidebar variants (`icon` / `labeled` / `palette`), preferences modal,
⌘K command palette. All driven by CSS variables in `theme.css`;
preferences persist in `localStorage`.

# For contributors

Everything below is for people extending this codebase — either the MCP
server, a GUI panel, or the tests. If that's not you, stop reading here;
the sections above are the complete user surface.

The shortest contributor onboarding lives in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): where new code goes per tier, the
non-negotiable invariants, testing patterns, and how to run the
end-to-end smoke probes.

## Status

Alpha. **81 MCP tools** (79 default + 2 opt-in), **421 tests** passing in
~10 seconds. End-to-end smoke probes:
`scripts/integration_drive.py` (40-step in-process drive: scaffold →
author → diagnose → warp → translate → distribute) and
`scripts/real_vn_drive.py` (drives a project that ships fal-generated
assets all the way to a real `<name>-<version>-pc.zip`). The tier model,
writer pipeline, and GUI architecture are stable; tool schemas may
still shift in minor ways.

## Architecture at a glance

- **MCP server** (`src/renpy_mcp/`) — tiered tool registry + one guarded
  write pipeline (`apply_write` in `project/writer.py`). Every mutation
  routes through it regardless of tier.
- **Project index** (`project/scanner.py`) — pragmatic regex scanner that
  surfaces labels, characters, images, audio, screens, variables,
  transforms. Refreshed after every write.
- **Guardrails** (`guardrails/`) — indent normalization, reserved-name
  checks, label-uniqueness checks, dialogue escaping. Pure functions;
  reused across tiers.
- **RPBuilder GUI** (`gui/`) — single FastAPI process spawns its own
  `renpy-mcp` stdio subprocess plus a watchdog observer that fans
  filesystem events out to WebSocket clients. REST endpoints are thin
  wrappers around MCP tool calls.

Deep dive in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Tier breakdown

- **Tier 1** (default on) — 30 read tools (introspection, structured
  label-tree read, choice graph, translation coverage, in-process
  diagnostics with sidecar suppression, `get_recent_edits` for agent
  self-query of the per-process write history, plus `bind_project` for
  rebinding the session mid-conversation to any existing project root)
  + 7 lifecycle tools
  (`launch_preview`, `stop_preview`, `get_preview_status`, `warp_to`,
  `set_drafting_mode`, `generate_translation_scaffolding`,
  `build_distribution`). Lifecycle tools spawn the Ren'Py SDK; the
  reads never do.
- **Tier 2** (default on) — 27 guarded write primitives. One Ren'Py
  construct per tool. Right layer for precise diffs. Includes the
  Phase 4 event tools (`add_pause`, `add_setvar`, `add_show`,
  `add_with_effect`, `add_flash`) that the Inspector's insert-event
  popup wires up, `add_menu` and `add_condition_branch` (the
  if/elif/else block primitive — single Ren'Py construct, single
  `apply_write` call), plus `update_menu_choice` (line-precise rewrite
  of a single choice's prompt — paired with the Choice View pill
  editor).
- **Tier 3** (default on) — 15 high-level authoring intents, including
  `new_project` (scaffolds a runnable skeleton and rebinds the session,
  returns a `next_steps` array steering small models toward
  `set_start_target` after authoring), `set_start_target` itself
  (rewrites `label start:` to a single `jump <target>` so the player
  actually lands on your opening), and the three composer tools
  (`add_screen_layout`, `add_stage`, `add_imagemap`). The Menu Composer panel calls the Tier 2 `add_menu`
  primitive directly — it is a single-construct emit, not a true
  composition. Composes multiple Tier 2 writes when the intent calls
  for it; the primary surface for agents.
- **Tier 4** (opt-in) — 2 escape hatches: `apply_unified_diff` (strict
  context-match diff applier; supports creation, refuses deletion) and
  `exec_python_in_init` (ast-validated `init python:` block appender).
  Can touch arbitrary file content — that's the point.

Configure with `--tiers 1,2,3,4` (default `1,2,3`). See §2 of
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#2-the-tiered-tool-model) for how to pick a tier
when adding a tool.

## Tool naming convention

- `snake_case`; action-first for writes (`add_say`, `swap_background`),
  noun-first for reads (`list_labels`, `read_label`).
- No `renpy_` prefix — the harness already namespaces tools as
  `mcp_<server>_<tool>`. Doubling up wastes characters in tool names
  that small models have to attend to.
- Stay <=25 chars where possible.
- Descriptions are written for small-model accuracy: terse, exact,
  one-line where feasible, extra paragraphs only for non-obvious
  constraints.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fracturedring/renpy-mcp
cd renpy-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"

# MCP server tests
pytest -q

# Frontend production build
cd gui/frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

The test suite takes ~9 seconds. Some tests (`test_gui_backend.py`,
anything calling `get_lint_report`) are module-skipped when `RENPY_SDK`
is not set — that's expected locally without the SDK; they run in full
when `RENPY_SDK` points at a Ren'Py install.

Smoke test against the fixture project:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py \
  --project tests/fixtures/tiny_project \
  --sdk $RENPY_SDK
```

## Adding a new tool

Short version:

1. Pick a tier (see [DESIGN §2](DESIGN.md#2-the-tiered-tool-model)).
2. Add a `_my_tool(config, index) -> ToolDef` factory to
   `tools/tierN_*.py` with a JSON-schema `input_schema`
   (`additionalProperties: False`, explicit `required` list).
3. Build new content in the handler, then call `apply_write` via
   `write_response` from `_shared.py`. Catch `WriteRejected` and return
   `err(...)`.
4. Register the tool in the tier's `register()` function.
5. Add happy-path + rejection tests in `tests/test_tierN.py`, using the
   `workspace` fixture (copies the fixture project into `tmp_path`).
6. If the GUI should expose it, add a thin FastAPI endpoint in
   `gui/backend/src/renpy_mcp_gui/app.py` (module-scope Pydantic body
   model) and wire it into a panel.

Longer version with rationale: [DESIGN §6](DESIGN.md#6-adding-a-new-tool-step-by-step).

## Non-goals (what this repo explicitly does NOT do)

- Animations panel — Ren'Py's ATL doesn't fit a multi-track timeline.
- Chat panel inside the GUI — adding one breaks the single-integration-
  point model (the file system).
- Authoritative Ren'Py parse — `ProjectIndex` is a pragmatic scanner,
  not a parser. For true syntactic reasoning, call Ren'Py via
  `get_lint_report`.
- File deletion via `apply_unified_diff` — out of scope; will land as
  its own tool when needed.

## License

AGPL-3.0-or-later — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The project relicensed from MIT to AGPL-3.0 in commit-after-`c728830` to
enable code-level adaptation from AGPL-licensed Ren'Py IDEs (notably
[bluemoonfoundry/bmf-vangard-renpy-ide](https://github.com/bluemoonfoundry/bmf-vangard-renpy-ide)).
Snapshots taken before that commit remain MIT-licensed.

**What AGPL means in practice for users:**

- Forks and modifications must stay AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- The §13 network clause applies to the GUI: anyone who runs the GUI as
  a hosted service for users beyond themselves must offer the
  corresponding source to those users.
- MCP harnesses (Claude Code, hermes-agent, Cursor) communicate with the
  server over stdio as separate processes. They are not derivative
  works of the server merely by calling its tools.
